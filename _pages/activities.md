In my spare time, I love to be accompanied by music. Fun fact about me: I was trained as a professional singer (similar to Bel canto). I also play flute, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulusi">cucurbit flute</a>, and piano for fun. Sometimes I also read mysteries and watch classical concerts.
