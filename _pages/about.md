<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics with Honors from the University of Pittsburgh.

Fun fact about me: I was trained as a professional singer (similar to Bel canto). I also play flute, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulusi">cucurbit flute</a>, and piano for fun. Sometimes I also read mysteries and watch classical concerts.
