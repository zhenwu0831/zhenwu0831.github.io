<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Welcome to my website! :-)

I'm a first-year [Master of Language Technologies](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/mlt.html) (MLT) student at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/index.html), School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor [Carolyn Ros√©](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/).

I'm excited to develop <u><b>generalizable</b></u> and <u><b>interpretable</b></u> models. Specifically, I'm very interested in

<ol class="important-points">
<li>Language models + reasoning and its applications in conversational settings.</li>
<li>Understanding and controlling language model behaviors through their inner workings using interpretability methods.</li>
</ol>

Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics with Honors from the University of Pittsburgh.

Fun fact about me: I was trained as a professional singer (similar to Bel canto). I also play flute, the [cucurbit flute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulusi), and piano for fun. Sometimes I also read mysteries and watch classical concerts.
